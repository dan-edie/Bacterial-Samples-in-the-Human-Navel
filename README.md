# plotly-challenge

This project uses data on bacteria that were found in specific peoples' navel's. It uses Plotly to create a dashboard that allows
the user to select specific individuals, access their data, and show plots of the bacteria in their navel. The dashboard shows the
following:
- An info box with demographic data on the subject,
- A bar plot of the top ten bacteria samples found,
- A dial that visualizes the frequency the subject washed their navel, and
- A bubble chart showing the bacteria found, with each point sized according to the number of bacterial samples found.

The most difficult part of this project was building the drop-down menu; however, I found D3 to be the best solution to populate
the menu. Once that was complete, the rest of the project was faily simple. 

Things that can be improved:
- Adjusting the visuals on the dial to be "prettier"

Next steps:
- Creating dashboards for a data project with similiar plots or visuals. Such data sets could include other bacterial data studies,
or other types of data collection that include frequencies. It could also be interesting to find data on speeds of objects as an excuse
to make the dial look like a speedometer.
